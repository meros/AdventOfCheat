# Advent of CHEAT!

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge event created by Eric Wastl. The event consists of a series of puzzles released every day from December 1st to December 25th. The goal of the event is to solve as many puzzles as possible using your programming skills.

In Advent of Code 2022, I will be using an OpenAI chatbot to help me solve the challenges. The chatbot, called Assistant, is a large language model trained by OpenAI. It has access to a vast amount of information and is able to provide solutions to a wide range of problems.
